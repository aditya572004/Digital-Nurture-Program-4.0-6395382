Scenario 1: The bank needs to process monthly interest for all savings accounts.

Scenario 2: The bank wants to implement a bonus scheme for employees based on their performance.
        ? Question: Write a stored procedure UpdateEmployeeBonus that updates the salary of employees 
            in a given department by adding a bonus percentage passed as a parameter.

Scenario 3: Customers should be able to transfer funds between their accounts.
